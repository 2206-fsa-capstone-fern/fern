# Fern

Welcome to Fern, your next personal finance app. The app was created using Firebase, Express, React, Node.js, and Bootstrap. With the help of the Plaid API, we allow users to link a test bank account and dynamically display bank data with Chart.js.

# To Get Started

https://fern-finances.vercel.app/

1. Go to the link above
2. Sign up for a Fern account
3. You will see a prompt to link a bank account. Banks are linked using the Plaid API's sandbox environment, so no personal information is used or collected. Select any bank account and use the following login information to proceed:

   Username: user_good
   Password: pass_good

4. Then, follow the prompts to finish connecting to a bank account
5. Once connected, you will be brought to the Dashboard
6. When on the Dashboard, please visit https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo, then click on the "Request temporary access to the demo server" button. You can close the tab after "You currently have temporary access to the demo server" shows up in bold underneath the button
7. Refresh the tab you have Fern opened in to view the data and to use our features on the sidebar

# To Run Locally
