# Fern

Welcome to Fern Finances, your next personal finance app created using Firebase, Express, React, and Node.js. With the help of the Plaid API, we can pull data from user's bank accounts and dynamically display them through visuals with Chart.js. 

# To Get Started
https://fern-finances.vercel.app/

1. Go to the link above
2. Sign up for a Fern account 
3. When prompted to connect to a bank account, follow the provided instructions
   If you do not feel comfortable sharing this information, don't worry, you can select any bank institution and use the following login:
   Username: user_good
   Password: pass_good
     These are the credentials to a test bank account, so no personal information is used or collected
4. Once connected, you will be brought to the Dashboard
5. When on the Dashboard, please visit https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo, then click on the "Request temporary access to the demo server" button and close the tab after "You currently have temporary access to the demo server." shows up underneath
